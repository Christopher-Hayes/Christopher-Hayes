## ðŸ‘‹ I am Chris Hayes

### I'm a software engineer who has a passion for design

âš¡ I mostly work with Vue, React, Electron, and WebGL to build websites and desktop applications.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on setting up my home IoT with the OSS, home-assistant.io.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Next.JS as part of a project to redesign and rebuild my personal website at chris.hayes.software.

ðŸ˜„ **Tech I'm most excited to work with** (2021)

- StackBlitz Web Containers - StackBlitz is still ironing out some things, but Web Containers have the potential to totally change the face of development.
- Flutter - Flutter has quickly become a huge player in the web + mobile app industry. As a web developer, I'd like to see how Flutter brings web apps to native mobile.
- WebFlow - Non-code solutions should still be in a web developer's toolkit, I'd like to get the chance to see how WebFlow compares.
