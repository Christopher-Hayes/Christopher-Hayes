## üßã Chris Hayes

### I'm a full-stack engineer, with a passion for frontend design

‚ö° I work most with Vue, Nuxt, Tailwind, and WebGL to build websites and desktop apps

üî≠ Lastest hobby project: Use Google AppScript to run automations on Google Sheet data

üå± Learning Flutter right now for a special project

## DEV | 2021

### üé® Tailwind

Tailwind is the 2020s equivalent of the 2010s Bootstrap. It feels more flexible, more modern, more efficent. Giving an HTML element a dozen classes still doesn't feel right, and I still right CSS from time to time. But, the quicker frontend development time is indisputable.

### ‚ö° StackBlitz Web Containers

Released in 2021. StackBlitz Web containers look like the future of instant web development. But, StackBlitz's git system still needs work and attempting to connect projects to GitHub is often completely broken. It probably won't be till 2022-2023 StackBlitz Web Containers can be anything but experimental.

### üì± Flutter

Quickly overtaking React Native as the cross-platform mobile frontend of choice, Flutter brings speed to the development process. Currently, working with Flutter on a not-yet-announced project.

### üë®‚Äçüíª WebFlow

WebFlow has separated itself as _the_ no-code platform that is more than drag-and-drop. Non-code solutions should still be in a web developer's toolkit, I'd like to get the chance to see how WebFlow compares.
